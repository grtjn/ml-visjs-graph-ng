# MarkLogic VisJS Graph Visualization

This AngularJS library allows you to easily produce a graph visualization for
triples stored in MarkLogic, based on the [VisJS Network
library](http://visjs.org/docs/network/). It is specifically designed with
applications generated by the [MarkLogic SlushJS
generator](https://github.com/marklogic/slush-marklogic-node) in mind.

## Getting Started

    bower install ml-visjs-graph-ng --save

## Directives Provided

TODO

## Example Implementation

Add the `ml.visjsGraph` module as a dependency to your app.module. For
example, in a [slush-generated
app](https://github.com/marklogic/slush-marklogic-node), add this to
`ui/app/app.js`:

```javascript
angular.module('app', [
   # ...
  'ml.visjsGraph,
  # ...
]);
```
