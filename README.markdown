# MarkLogic VisJS Graph Visualization

This AngularJS library allows you to easily produce a graph visualization for
triples stored in MarkLogic, based on the [VisJS Network
library](http://visjs.org/docs/network/). It is specifically designed with
applications generated by the [MarkLogic SlushJS
generator](https://github.com/marklogic/slush-marklogic-node) in mind.

## Getting Started

    bower install ml-visjs-graph-ng --save

## Example Implementation

Add the `ml.visjsGraph` module as a dependency to your app.module. For
example, in a [slush-generated
app](https://github.com/marklogic/slush-marklogic-node), add this to
`ui/app/app.js`:

```javascript
angular.module('app', [
   # ...
  'ml.visjsGraph,
  # ...
]);
```

## Sample Data

The original [slush-generated
app](https://github.com/marklogic/slush-marklogic-node) comes with 3000 JSON
documents representing people. For the moment, those documents do not include
triples.

This code repository has the same JSON documents, enriched with triples
representing foaf:knows relationships, an rdf:type, and an rdfs:label for each
document. To use, you can replace the original `sample-data.zip` file in the
slush-generated app with the `sample-data.zip` file in this project.
(Eventually, the slush-generated app may use this project's version with
triples.)

Then, you can load them with
(MLCP)[https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/ingestion/content-pump] like this:

    ./ml local mlcp -options_file import-sample-data.options

Or on Windows:

    ml.bat local mlcp -options_file import-sample-data.options
